# Bull run

This indicator is not good for trading on the markets, but it helps to understand what phase of the market we are in.

The snapshot above is an example showing Bitcoin going through three bullish annual cycles and one bearish annual cycle from 2015 to 2017. Usually the crypto market in a bull run has 3 bullish annual cycles and a usually shorter bearish annual cycle. In this case, in fact, the shortest cycle lasts 308 days.

The moving averages that we are going to use to analyze the market are those at 52 and 26 periods. The weekly timeframe indicates 52 periods which means 52 weeks, that is 1 year, while 26 periods means 180 days, that is half a year.

It makes no sense to use these averages in other timeframes.

If the fast 26-period average crosses the slow 52-period average upwards, this could mark the start of the bull run; vice versa the bullrun could be terminated.
