# PineScript

The goal of this repository is to collect technical indicators and tools implemented using the Pine Script language.
In some cases the basic implementations were used as a starting point, but modified and adapted to the particular operational context.
Next to each indicator it is possible to read a brief description of the indicator itself and the motivation that led to the implementation choice.

If you appreciate my work, you can give me a tip :)
Thank you very much!
