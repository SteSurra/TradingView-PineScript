Death cross is the opposite of a golden cross. It is a chart pattern where a short-term MA crosses bearish with a long-term MA. For example, when the 50-day MA crosses down the 200-day MA.
Therefore, a death cross is usually considered a bearish signal.

Typically, a death cross occurs in three stages:
1. The short-term MA sits above the long-term MA during an uptrend.
2. The trend reverses, and the short-term MA crosses down the long-term MA.
3. A downtrend begins where the short-term MA stays below the long-term MA.

In classic markets, the death cross is considered by the institutions as a very negative signal for which many positions are closed. The reason is that the death cross marks the transition to a medium / long-term bearish trend.

In classic markets, weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) are not bargaining times. It follows that the classic month from the point of view of the hold markets is about 20 days, while a year is about 200 days.

The 50-period average was chosen because it represents 75% of three months in the traditional market: 
```
0.75 (22 * 3) = 49.5-> 50.
```
22 is the typical month of traditional markets which does not consider Saturday and Sunday, while 3 is the quarter, ie 3 months. The 200-period average is 75% of a year.

According to what was said before, for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies it would be wrong to consider the average at 50 and 200 periods. In fact, longer averages would be needed since the crypto currency market is open 24 hours a day. Always considering 75% of a quarter and 75% of a year, we get: MA1: 68 days, MA2: 274 days.
